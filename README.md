You can use this with a [neurosky headset](http://www.amazon.com/NeuroSky-MindWave-Mobile-BrainWave-Starter/dp/B00B8BF4EM).

I don't think it really improves upon the bundled app too much, but eventually maybe I will link it with other things and improve the UI. This one is open-source and easy to modify, though!

If you aren't interested in building it yourself, try a [release](https://github.com/brainbang/mindgraph/releases)

If you'd like to use the library I used here, in nodejs, in your own thing, check out [mindwave](https://github.com/brainbang/mindwave).

## development

Install the build dependencies with `npm install`. You can build runtimes with `npm run build`, and you can test (run on current platform) with `npm start`.
